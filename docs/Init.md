# The Muse

I initially set out to build a simple API that would integrate with a Discord
bot to allow users to plant and grow a garden. Some bots have made up currency
systems that allow people to gamble, play trivia, and challenge one another. I
thought that it would be nice if this experience revolved around plants.
Additionally, I'm pondering how I can make this social experience perhaps
provide something of a allegory between the maintenance a plant needs and that
of a person, friendship, and community.

#### Target Audience

Out of the gate, I want this experience to have a few core features:

- The complexity cap is somewhere around highschool biology (i.e. use of
  phenotypes and basic genetics)
  - I think it would be very cool if each person could have an heirloom seed (or be
    able to produce one).
- The complexity to enter is understanding that for any plant to grow it
  needs food, water, sun, and chill
- There will be a set of random events that can occur that reflect how plants
  might be pest ridden, get a disease, or grow slower than usual.
    - I think it would be extremely cool to link this to real world weather data
- Though I also want a core tone of emotional skills and opportunity creation
  - For example, when a garden is _neglected_ the goal isn't to punish the
    user, but rather create a noticeable enough hiccup to cause an
    opportunity to explore what neglect means
  - I think there's going to be a secondary loop that allows users to
    interact with their friends gardens in ways that provide opportunities
    for people to make communities

#### Core Theme

I hope that this can give people a allegory for relating to people (e.g. when
they don't produce, do you just toss em out?) and provide a rich environment for
them to discover questions about emotions they might not know they are asking.

Like Bob Ross but for plants and friendship.

#### Experience

I expect this to be primarily a text-based "game", but also fancy the idea of
using some silly stock photo for some of the crops. Because of this the core
loop will be something like 'inspect, assess, act'. The sole goal the player
is trying to obtain is a consistent garden. Writ large -- having a larger garden
is secondary to this; furthermore, it will be come exponentially harder for
someone to have a consistent and large farm. They will need to leverage their
community.

While hard work to produce hearty seeds is possible it should be unreasonable in
the light of parallel farming and mutual support. It's possible there's a 
ranking/level system that if users produce X number of a selection of crops per
week they are at that level. The tutorial cadence I'm seeing now is:

1. Learn how to grow
2. Be introduced to consistency is king (i.e. genetics)
3. First level up (introduces competing forces of consistency and farm scale)
4. Encounter more pressure for communal farming to scale and keep consistency
5. Community goals

#### Social Integration

The notion of plants and growing a farm seems quite intuitive and there are a 
plethora of games to look to for guidance that builds their loop on exactly this.
However, I'm curious about how to encourage users to form communities. I think
one way is odds of mutation being higher. If I can only grow 5 crops then you 
and me together can grow 10. Thus, the odds of getting mutation 'xyz' is higher.

Though I imagine that people would want to form communities to address the 
scaling issue, but maybe they should address the consistency issue. Or maybe 
there's private gardens and then community gardens. The benefit of growing in 
the community garden is the cross-pollination from other people's plants is
greatly increased. Also you might have some people helping you out because they
recognize the benefits of having those plants in the community garden.

Maybe plants can have certain modifiers. These modifiers are simply luck based
mutations that must be observed and selectively bred to keep them alive (I think
that the breeding aspect of it would become quickly too complex). Have these 
modifiers only happen at very low odds and have a chance to be recessive.

I think this definitely echos the reality that each person brings valuable energy
and cultivatable wisdom to the community they are a part of. Each one will 
require a different amount of resources, but at some point it's not about the
cost-benefit analysis but rather do you want this person in your community.
